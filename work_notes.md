### Environment
I am using the torch environment from torch_env.txt
TODO: Add a way to read the environment from the file

Original code comes from [LearnOpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/mask-r-cnn-instance-segmentation-with-pytorch/)

I adjusted the blog tu use GPU from analyticsvidhya [blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/02/mask-r-cnn-for-instance-segmentation-using-pytorch/)
